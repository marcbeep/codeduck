    "explanation": "This solution uses the \"expand around center\" approach:\n1. For each position in the string, we treat it as a potential center of a palindrome\n2. We expand outward from the center while characters match\n3. We check both odd-length palindromes (single character center) and even-length palindromes (two character center)\n4. We keep track of the longest palindrome found so far\n5. We return the longest palindrome\n\nExample: s = \"babad\"\n- Center at index 0: expand \"b\" → \"b\" (length 1)\n- Center at index 1: expand \"a\" → \"aba\" (length 3)\n- Center at index 2: expand \"b\" → \"bab\" (length 3)\n- Center at index 3: expand \"a\" → \"a\" (length 1)\n- Center at index 4: expand \"d\" → \"d\" (length 1)\n- Result: \"bab\" or \"aba\" (both length 3)\n\nAlternative approach using dynamic programming:\n- We can use a 2D DP array where dp[i][j] represents if s[i:j+1] is a palindrome\n- We fill the DP array and keep track of the longest palindrome\n\nThe time complexity is O(n²) as we check each position as a center and expand. The space complexity is O(1) as we only use a constant amount of extra space."
