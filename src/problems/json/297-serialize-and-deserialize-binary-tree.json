  "description": "Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.\n\nDesign an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.\n\nClarification: The input/output format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.",

    "explanation": "This solution uses preorder traversal (DFS):\n- Serialization: use preorder traversal (root -> left -> right), represent null as \"null\"\n- Deserialization: split string by commas, use global index to track position\n- Recursively build tree using preorder traversal\n- Time complexity: O(n) for both operations\n- Space complexity: O(n) for recursion stack and serialized string"
