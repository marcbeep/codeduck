  "description": "You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.\n\nYou may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.",
  "constraints": [
    "The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100]",

    "explanation": "Use a dummy head to simplify result construction. Process both lists simultaneously while handling carry. Continue until both lists are exhausted and no carry remains.\n\nTime complexity: O(max(n, m)) where n and m are list lengths\nSpace complexity: O(max(n, m)) for the result list\n\nKey insight: Process digits from least significant to most significant, maintaining carry throughout."
