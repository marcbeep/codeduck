  "description": "There is an m x n rectangular island that borders both the Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean. The Pacific Ocean touches the island's left and top edges, and the Atlantic Ocean touches the island's right and bottom edges.\n\nThe island is partitioned into a grid of square cells. You are given an m x n integer matrix heights where heights[r][c] represents the height above sea level of the cell at coordinate (r, c).\n\nThe island receives a lot of rain, and the rain water can flow to neighboring cells directly north, south, east, and west if the neighboring cell's height is less than or equal to the current cell's height. Water can flow from any cell adjacent to an ocean into the ocean.\n\nReturn a 2D list of grid coordinates result where result[i] = [ri, ci] denotes that rain water can flow from cell (ri, ci) to both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.",

    "explanation": "This solution uses DFS with O(m*n) time complexity:\n1. We use two sets to track cells that can reach Pacific and Atlantic oceans\n2. We start DFS from all cells on the Pacific edges (left and top)\n3. We start DFS from all cells on the Atlantic edges (right and bottom)\n4. During DFS, we only move to cells with equal or higher height\n5. We return the intersection of both sets (cells that can reach both oceans)\n\nThe time complexity is O(m*n) as we visit each cell at most twice. The space complexity is O(m*n) for the sets.\n\nThe key insight is that we reverse the flow - instead of checking if water can flow from each cell to oceans, we check if water can flow from oceans to each cell."
