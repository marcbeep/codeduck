    "explanation": "This solution uses a dummy node approach to merge the lists:\n1. We create a dummy node to handle edge cases and maintain a current pointer\n2. While both lists have nodes:\n   - Compare the values of current nodes from both lists\n   - Link the smaller node to our merged list\n   - Move the pointer in the list we took the node from\n3. After one list is exhausted, attach the remaining nodes from the other list\n4. Return the merged list starting from dummy.next\n\nThe time complexity is O(n + m) where n and m are the lengths of the input lists, as we process each node exactly once. The space complexity is O(1) as we only use a constant amount of extra space regardless of input size."
