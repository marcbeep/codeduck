  "description": "Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (push, peek, pop, and empty).\n\nImplement the MyQueue class:\n- void push(int x) Pushes element x to the back of the queue.\n- int pop() Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.\n- int peek() Returns the element at the front of the queue.\n- boolean empty() Returns true if the queue is empty, false otherwise.\n\nNotes:\n- You must use only standard operations of a stack, which means only push to top, peek/pop from top, size, and is empty operations are valid.\n- Depending on your language, stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a stack's standard operations.",

    "1 <= x <= 9",

      "explanation": "MyQueue myQueue = new MyQueue();\nmyQueue.push(1); // queue is: [1]\nmyQueue.push(2); // queue is: [1, 2] (leftmost is front of the queue)\nmyQueue.peek(); // return 1\nmyQueue.pop(); // return 1, queue is [2]\nmyQueue.empty(); // return false"

    "explanation": "This solution uses two stacks:\n1. Use two stacks: stack_in for push operations, stack_out for pop/peek\n2. When pop/peek is called and stack_out is empty, transfer all elements from stack_in\n3. This maintains FIFO order: elements pushed first come out first\n4. Amortized time complexity: O(1) for all operations\n5. Space complexity: O(n) where n is the number of elements\n\nKey insight: Transferring elements from stack_in to stack_out reverses their order, creating the FIFO behavior needed for a queue."
