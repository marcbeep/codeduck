You may return the combinations in any order.\n\nThe same number may be chosen from candidates an unlimited number of times. Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.\n\nThe test cases are generated such that the number of unique combinations that sum up to target is less than 150 combinations for the given input.",

    "explanation": "This solution uses backtracking with O(n^(target/min)) time complexity:\n1. We use a recursive backtracking approach to explore all possible combinations\n2. At each step, we try adding each candidate to our current combination\n3. We can reuse the same candidate multiple times, so we don't increment the start index\n4. We backtrack by removing the last added candidate and trying the next one\n5. We add a combination to our result when the target becomes 0\n\nThe time complexity is O(n^(target/min)) where n is the number of candidates and min is the minimum candidate value. The space complexity is O(target/min) for the recursion stack.\n\nKey insights:\n- This is a classic backtracking problem with unlimited reuse of candidates\n- We use a start index to avoid duplicate combinations (e.g., [2,3] and [3,2])\n- We can prune early when target becomes negative\n- Sorting candidates can help with pruning but is not necessary\n- The recursion naturally handles the combination building\n\nExample: For candidates [2,3,6,7] and target 7:\n- Start with 2: [2] -> target 5 -> [2,2] -> target 3 -> [2,2,2] -> target 1 -> [2,2,2,2] -> target -1 (backtrack)\n- Try 3: [2,2,3] -> target 0 (found combination)\n- Continue exploring other combinations"
