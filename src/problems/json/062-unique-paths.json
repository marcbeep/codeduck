  "description": "There is a robot on an m x n grid. The robot is initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.\n\nGiven the two integers m and n, return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.\n\nThe test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 109.",

    "code": "def uniquePaths(m: int, n: int) -> int:\n    # Create a 2D DP array\n    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]\n    \n    # Base case: first row and first column have only 1 path\n    for i in range(m):\n        dp[i][0] = 1\n    for j in range(n):\n        dp[0][j] = 1\n    \n    # Fill the DP array\n    for i in range(1, m):\n        for j in range(1, n):\n            # Paths to current cell = paths from above + paths from left\n            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]\n    \n    return dp[m-1][n-1]",
    "explanation": "This solution uses dynamic programming:\n- dp[i][j] represents number of unique paths to reach cell (i,j)\n- Base cases: first row and first column have only 1 path each\n- For each cell: dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1] (paths from above + paths from left)\n- Time complexity: O(m*n), Space complexity: O(m*n)"
